What makes it unique? Ultimately, it will store all your notes in a GitHub repo. Therefore, the app has no backend - just authentication and storage through GitHub. Right now, the app is about 90% complete, with all the functionality ready, but it's using local storage to store all the data until the sync with GitHub's APIs are complete.</p>\n<p>TakeNote is huge for me, as it's been my first large-scale collaborative effort. It has been built with the help of <a href=\"https://github.com/taniarascia/takenote/graphs/contributors\">30 contributors</a>! At one point it even reached the top spot on GitHub trending, and I was overwhelmed with pull requests for a week or two. I'm excited to get this finished, and I learned a ton about TypeScript, Redux, and Hooks while building it.</p>\n<p>Here is the current example site: <a href=\"https://takenote.dev/\">TakeNote.dev</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"chip8js\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#chip8js\" aria-label=\"chip8js permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Chip8.js</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/taniarascia/chip8\">Chip8.js</a> is very different from everything else I've done, and pretty different from what most people do in JavaScript. It's an emulator that interprets Chip8 roms, which were used in some 1970s microcomputers. It plays simple games like Pong, Tetris, Space Invaders, and so on.</p>\n<p>While Chip8 emulators have been done before in JavaScript, what makes this one unique is the generic CPU interface it uses to hook up to multiple different graphical interfaces. There's a browser version, a terminal version, and a native GUI version of Chip8.js, all of which share the same CPU. I learned a ton while writing this, and I plan to write about the whole process once it's totally finished. It's at about 90% complete at the moment as well.</p>\n<p>You can view the browser version here: <a href=\"https://taniarascia.github.io/chip8/\">Chip8 Web</a> (However, it only uses key input and they're not listed, so doing anything might be difficult until I add those instructions).</p>\n<h3 id=\"miscellaneous\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#miscellaneous\" aria-label=\"miscellaneous permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Miscellaneous</h3>\n<p>I made a few small other projects.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://taniarascia.github.io/mvc\">MVC Todo</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/taniarascia/mvc\">Source</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/taniarascia/snek\">Snake (Terminal)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/taniarascia/webpack-boilerplate\">Webpack Boilerplate</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"i-moved-from-wordpress-to-gatsby\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#i-moved-from-wordpress-to-gatsby\" aria-label=\"i moved from wordpress to gatsby permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>I moved from WordPress to Gatsby</h2>\n<p>It's hard to believe that this site was on WordPress from 2015 to 2019, and it wasn't until the middle of 2019 that I finally moved to Gatsby. I wrote <a href=\"/my-blog/migrating-from-wordpress-to-gatsby/\">The End of an Era: Migrating from WordPress to Gatsby</a> as I migrated to help others wanting to make the switch.

Now it has <strong>8,430</strong>! I hate spam, and I basically never want to receive any email that isn't directly from a person to me, so I send as few emails as possible. Usually around one per month, when I write something new.</p>\n<p>So far, my newsletter journey has been <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/\">MailChimp</a> to <a href=\"https://sendy.co/\">Sendy</a> to <a href=\"https://substack.com/\">Substack</a>. MailChimp was good, but their prices become obnoxiously high after you reach the limit (which is 1k or 2k subscribers, something along those lines). The lowest tier was way beyond my budget, since my newsletter is simple a subscription service that does not sell anything and does not make me any money. I then bought Sendy for about $60 and set it up on an AWS EC2 server with SES for email. Unfortunately, AWS kept sending all my emails directly to spam for no reason, and after about 15-20 emails back and forth with their support, I finally switched. Then a week later, they sent me an email acknowledging that the issue was on their end and it was fixed now, but by then I had already moved on.</p>\n<p>So now I use <a href=\"https://substack.com/\">Substack</a>, which is awesome! It seems too good to be true, because I get to send my simple emails for free. Hopefully they stick around.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-had-32-million-sessions\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#i-had-32-million-sessions\" aria-label=\"i had 32 million sessions permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>I had 3.2 million sessions</h2>\n<p>From <strong>December 21, 2018</strong> to <strong>December 21, 2019</strong>, there were <strong>3,199,780</strong> sessions on this website, compared to <strong>1,910,587</strong> from the previous year. <strong>85%</strong> of that traffic comes from organic search (Google).</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

I learned about modules, loaders, plugins, and all the major Webpack concepts. This boilerplate has all the necessities, and any other add-ons (TypeScript, React) will just require adding a single loader. I'm now comfortable setting up my own Webpack config for production (instead of using Create React App) and I have a lot more control.</p>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-testing\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#advanced-testing\" aria-label=\"advanced testing permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Advanced testing</h3>\n<p>Before this year, I hadn't done much with testing beyond setting up a few unit tests in <a href=\"https://jestjs.io/\">Jest</a>, but this year I got a ton of practice using <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest\">Supertest</a> in Node/Express and <a href=\"https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library\">React Testing Library</a> for React component tests.

I can't decide if I like Vue or React more (though I really wish React had something like <code class=\"language-text\">$emit</code>) but I feel comfortable using both equally at this point.

I wrote some more articles on React, about <a href=\"/my-blog/using-context-api-in-react/\">Context</a> and <a href=\"/my-blog/using-react-router-spa/\">Routing</a>. I built TakeNote entirely with functional React Hooks and Redux, though I still find React Classes to be more intuitive, personally. React is ever-evolving and I use it on a daily basis, so I'm sure I'll end up learning a bunch more about React next year, too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"redux\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#redux\" aria-label=\"redux permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Redux</h3>\n<p>I put off learning Redux for a long time. Every time I looked at it, it just seemed very overwhelming and different than anything else I'd done. I built <a href=\"https://github.com/taniarascia/takenote\">TakeNote</a> with Redux, so I was learning something alongside building it, and alongside learning TypeScript. It was a bit of a challenge, but now I understand why Redux is so useful, and at what point an app might need it. (For example, I built an app in plain Context recently, and it has become large enough that I feel like I should convert it to Redux soon.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"typescript\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#typescript\" aria-label=\"typescript permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>TypeScript</h3>\n<p>I had never used TypeScript before this year, so I decided to write <a href=\"https://github.com/taniarascia/tictactoe\">Tic Tac Toe</a> in TypeScript to teach myself, then applied that to <a href=\"https://github.com/taniarascia/takenote\">TakeNote</a>. I'm not sure if I'm quite the TypeScript evangelist that some people are yet, but I do find it interesting and useful to learn, and it's helpful for catching a certain class of bugs.
